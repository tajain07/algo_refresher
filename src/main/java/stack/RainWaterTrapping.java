/**
 *  Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 * Input: arr[]   = {2, 0, 2}
 * Output: 2
 * Structure is like below
 * | |
 * |_|
 * We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.
 *
 * Input: arr[]   = {3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4}
 * Output: 10
 * Structure is like below
 *      |
 * |    |
 * |  | |
 * |__|_|
 * We can trap "3*2 units" of water between 3 an 2,
 * "1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2
 * and 4.  See below diagram also.
